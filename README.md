# BrainViewer
BrainViewer is a simple MATLAB application built for viewing brain imaging data including CT, MRI, and electrode recontructions. This software acts as a wrapper for the [iELVis imaging repository](https://github.com/iELVis/iELVis) and requires that repository to operate properly.  

NOTE: This software has also been made to work in conjunction with the [StimulationMapper application](https://github.com/adkinson/StimulationMapper), which can use BrainViewer to generate simple real-time visualizations of which electrodes implanted in the brain detect responsive behavior from stimulation.

For more details on proper utilization of the application, visit the [Wiki].
