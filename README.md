# BrainViewer
BrainViewer is a simple MATLAB application built for viewing brain imaging data including CT, MRI, and electrode recontructions. 

## Important Notes
1. This software acts as a wrapper for the [iELVis imaging repository](https://github.com/iELVis/iELVis) and requires that repository to operate properly.
2. This software has also been made to work in conjunction with the [StimulationMapper application](https://github.com/adkinson/StimulationMapper), which can use BrainViewer to generate simple real-time visualizations of which electrodes implanted in the brain detect responsive behavior from stimulation.

For more details on proper utilization and features of this application, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/adkinson/BrainViewer/wiki).
